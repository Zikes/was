was
===

Simple/stupid obstacle remover. It takes a file or directory named something like file11 and turns it into file11.was and vice-versa. 

Some file's in your way and you'll probably want it again later?  Was it.

You want to mess with some code and are pretty sure you'll screw it up?  Was it first.

You've installed a database, and want to move it aside and test a clean one?  Was it.

You've cloned you favorite project and want to clone some other guy's fork for a quick peek?  Was yours then clone his.

It sounds stupid but its very handy.

It leaves them all right in the same dir so you can see what you've been doing.
